Hi. I'm the developer of Cursed Blocks. I'm not a lawyer and copyright law is confusing. I think I'm legally obligated to include this text file with my game. I'm not sure what information I need to provide so I'm going to provide as much as possible.

My game, Cursed Blocks, uses a font named Titillium Web. It was designed by Accademia di Belle Arti di Urbino. I found it at this URL:
https://www.fontspace.com/titillium-web-font-f17244

The site (fontspace.com) seems to indicate that this font is free for all uses, including commercial ones, as long as you're not simply selling the font itself (which I am not). I am under the impression that I need to provide some sort of legal text, but the site is not making it clear WHAT legal text I need to provide.

The site says that this font is licensed as "SIL Open Font License (OFL)". So I googled that and found the text of that license. Turns out, there's a couple versions and there's no indication of which one is applicable. I would assume that version 1.1 is applicable, as the font was made in 2012 and version 1.1 is dated 2007. However, just to be safe, I have included the text of both versions. They are separated by a line with twenty-five consecutive equals-symbol characters (=).

The text of the two versions of the license are below.



Copyright (c) <dates>, <Copyright Holder> (<URL|email>),
with Reserved Font Name <Reserved Font Name>.
Copyright (c) <dates>, <additional Copyright Holder> (<URL|email>),
with Reserved Font Name <additional Reserved Font Name>.

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
